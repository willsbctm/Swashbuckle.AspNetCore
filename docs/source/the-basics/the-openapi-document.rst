The OpenAPI Document
==============================

Swashbuckle brings the power of the `OpenAPI 3.0 Specification <https://swagger.io/specification/>`_ (formerly Swagger Specification) and related tools (`Swagger UI <https://swagger.io/swagger-ui/>`_, `Swagger Codegen <https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen>`_, `ReDoc <https://github.com/Redocly/redoc>`_ etc.) to ASP.NET Core.

It does this by inspecting your application code (routes, controllers, models, attributes etc.) and generating "OpenAPI" documents that describe your API. It then exposes those documents as JSON or YAML endpoints that can be consumed by various tools in the Swagger ecosystem, including the Swagger UI and Swagger Codegen client generator.

The following example illustrates the basic structure of an OpenAPI document generated by Swashbuckle:

    .. literalinclude:: ..\..\..\test\WebSites\TheBasics\swagger.yaml
        :language: yaml
        :start-at: openapi:
        :end-before: info:

    .. literalinclude:: ..\..\..\test\WebSites\TheBasics\swagger.yaml
        :language: yaml
        :start-at: info:
        :end-before: servers:

    .. literalinclude:: ..\..\..\test\WebSites\TheBasics\swagger.yaml
        :language: yaml
        :start-at: servers:
        :end-before: paths:

    .. literalinclude:: ..\..\..\test\WebSites\TheBasics\swagger.yaml
        :language: yaml
        :start-at: paths:
        :end-before: x-operationId: CreateUser

    .. literalinclude:: ..\..\..\test\WebSites\TheBasics\swagger.yaml
        :language: yaml
        :start-at: components:

The ``openapi`` keyword specifies the *exact* version of the Open Specification that the document is based on - currently v3.0.1.

The ``servers`` section specifies the API server and base URL. All paths are relative to the server URL. For example, the OpenAPI document above states that the ``/users`` path is located at ``http://tempuri.org/users``. The spec allows multiple servers to be specified (e.g. production, sandbox etc.) but, out-of-the-box, Swashbuckle will include just one - the server where the OpenAPI document itself is being served from.

The ``info`` section contains general information about your API. With the default setup, Swashbuckle will set the ``title`` to the name of your Startup DLL and the ``version`` to "1.0". However, this data can be easily customized and enriched (e.g. adding a description, terms of service etc.) when configuring the Swagger generator. See #TODO for more info.

The ``paths`` section defines the various routes exposed by your API, and the HTTP methods (``operations``) supported for those routes. An operation definition includes parameters (if any), a request body (if any), possible response status codes (such as 200 OK of 404 Not Found) and response contents.

The ``components`` section defines various definitions (e.g. schemas, security schemes etc.) that can be referenced elsewhere in the document. For example, The "CreateUser" operation shown above defines a ``requestBody`` that references the "User" schema definition rather than defining it inline.
